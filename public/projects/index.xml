      <description>Climate change and temperature anomaliesThe aim of this project was to define temperature anomalies within the Northern Hemisphere considering as a base period the one between 1951 and 1980. In order to carry out my observations, I have utilized data provided by the NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

      <description>Let’s take a look at the voting history of countries in the United NationsGeneral Assembly. I will be using data from the unvotes package.I will make use of the tidyverse and lubridate packagesfor the analysis, and the DT package for interactive display of tabularoutput.
DataThe unvotes package provides three datasets I can work with: un_roll_calls,un_roll_call_issues, and un_votes. Each of these datasets contains avariable called rcid, the roll call id, which can be used as a uniqueidentifier to join them with each other.</description>
