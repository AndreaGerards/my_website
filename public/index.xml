      <description>IntroductionThe UK referendum on EU membership on 23 June 2016 is a key moment for European (dis)integration. Even though the outcome had been expected to be tight, in the days running up to the referendum bookmakers and pollsters predicted the ‘Remain’ side to win. Many observers were left puzzled and keen to understand who voted for ‘Leave’. Various newspapers and blogs quickly reported plots that relate the referendum vote to key characteristics such as the age profile of the population.</description>

      <description>OverviewMost people have an intuitive idea of personality that is not far away from how social scientists understand it. Our families are where we typically first learn that people have a degree of consistency in how they interact with others, and later as we make friends we interpret other people’s behavior in terms of character, personal style or habit. Later in the world of work we hear and see that leaders and co-workers succeed or have problems because of the way they work with others.</description>

      <description>OverviewEvery September, leaders from around the world gather at the United Nations in New York to debate and pass resolutions on the biggest issues facing the planet.
Established after World War II, the UN has grown from 51 members in 1945 to 193 members in 2019. It also has two non-member observer states, Palestine and The Holy See.
Roll-call voting in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has long attracted the attention of scholars; first to study the formation of voting blocs in the UNGA and more recently to create indicators for the common interests of states.</description>

      <title>Analysing weather and temperature anomalies</title>

      <description>OverviewWhen researching global climate changes and temperature data, you will often read about the “temperature anomaly.” That is the difference between the long-term average temperature (sometimes called a reference value) and the temperature that is actually occurring. In other words, the long-term average temperature is one that would be expected; the anomaly is the difference between what you would expect and what is happening.
A positive anomaly means that the temperature was warmer than normal; a negative anomaly indicates that the temperature was cooler than normal.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn some American neighborhoods, it’s hard to spot even one person outside without a face covering. In others, the odds of seeing many maskless people are quite high.
Public health officials believe that face coverings can substantially slow transmission of the coronavirus, which is spreading rapidly in many states. But face coverings work best if they are adopted widely, and that is not the case everywhere. The accompanying map shows the odds of whether, if you encountered five people in a given area, all of them would be wearing masks.</description>

      <description>OriginsMy name is Andrea Gerards and I am half German and half Italian. I grew up in Italy, in a city close to the Austrian border called Bolzano. I have played Basketball for over a decade but always used to practice other activities including tennis, football, volleyball and golf.
EducationI have attended a high school in scientific studies in Bolzano. My passion for economic matters led me then to join Bocconi in Milan for my Bachelor’s and I am now happy to be part of the LBS community.</description>
