<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>My name is Andrea Gerards and I am half German and half Italian. I grew up in <strong>Italy</strong>, in a city close to the Austrian border called <strong>Bolzano</strong>. I have played <a href="https://www.altoadige.it/sport/piani-l-under-15-si-laurea-campione-del-triveneto-1.413004">Basketball</a> for over a decade but always used to practice other activities including tennis, football, volleyball and golf.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I have attended a high school in scientific studies in Bolzano. My passion for economic matters led me then to join <em>Bocconi</em> in Milan for my Bachelorâ€™s and I am now happy to be part of the <em>LBS</em> community.</p>

<p>I have gained experience through a number of internships. My completed internships at <strong>Deloitte</strong>, <strong>Macquarie</strong>, <strong>PAI</strong> and <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> allowed me to get a unique insight in the fascinating financial sector.</p>
