## Origins
My name is Andrea Gerards and I am half German and half Italian. I grew up in **Italy**, in a city close to the Austrian border called **Bolzano**. I have played [Basketball](https://www.altoadige.it/sport/piani-l-under-15-si-laurea-campione-del-triveneto-1.413004) for over a decade but always used  to practice other activities including tennis, football, volleyball and golf. 

## Education
I have attended a high school in scientific studies in Bolzano. My passion for economic matters led me then to join *Bocconi* in Milan for my Bachelor's and I am now happy to be part of the *LBS* community. 

## Professional experiences
I have gained experience through a number of internships. My completed internships at **Deloitte**, **Macquarie**, **PAI Partners** and **Credit Suisse** allowed me to get a unique insight in the fascinating financial sector.
