### Overview 

Most people have an intuitive idea of personality that is not far away from how social scientists understand it. Our families are where we typically first learn that people have a degree of consistency in how they interact with others, and later as we make friends we interpret other peopleâ€™s behavior in terms of character, personal style or habit. Later in the world of work we hear and see that leaders and co-workers succeed or have problems because of the way they work with others.

Below you can find a spider chart of my main personality traits plotted after having completed a 100-question survey. The results have been compared to the ones of the LBS cohort. 

If you believe we can share similar traits, let's get in touch!
